# NGFW-Wazuh-Integration
This project focuses on configuring a Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) and integrating it with Wazuh, a security monitoring and management platform

The primary objective is to establish a secure network environment by:

- **Configuring an NGFW to manage and secure network traffic.**
- **Adding a client machine under the NGFW's protection.**
- **Monitoring both the NGFW and the client machine using Wazuh to ensure network visibility, detect threats, and respond effectively.**

The project provides a hands-on implementation of modern cybersecurity practices, suitable for network security enthusiasts and learners.

**Key Features:**

**NGFW Setup:**

    Deploy and configure a firewall with IDS/IPS capabilities (e.g., pfSense or a commercial NGFW).
    Define and enforce firewall policies to secure the network.
**Monitoring with Wazuh:**

    Collect and analyze NGFW logs through Syslog integration with Wazuh.
    Install and configure the Wazuh agent on the client machine for in-depth system monitoring.
    
**Security Analysis:**

    Centralize and correlate logs for both the NGFW and the client machine.
    Enable real-time alerting for network intrusions, suspicious activity, and system vulnerabilities.
